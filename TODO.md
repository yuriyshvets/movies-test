This TODO list is mostly a guideline to help you start the project.
Feel free to do your own thing, and to not even follow those guidelines.

The main point of evaluation will be the code that you submitted, how and why you did it.

# What do you have?

We gave you a basic Vue application generated by vue-cli.
You will work with data given by http://www.omdbapi.com
Do not hesitate to check the different files that we gave.

# What should you do?

The first thing is to do is for you to use the store to replace the "TODO" that you can find in the codebase.
Feel free to modify the store as much as you want.

## The movie detail page

The goal here is to display the informations regarding the movie in the URL.
You should not focus on the design of the page, the main goal is to connect it with the id present on the url.

Consider it done once you have the movie title and poster, polish it if you have time.

## Improve the movie list

In the home page there is currently no link to the detail page.
Your goal is to link it using a `router-link`.

You should also add a "load more" button to show other pages.
You are expected to add tests for this "load more".

Finally you can add filters on this page, to show only `series` or `movies` for example.
